 Hello everyone, this is Sujay. I am from Lucknow. It is the capital city of Uttar Pradesh. It is an amazing city. It has a great history and the food here is delicious. The Tunday Kebabs of Lucknow are very famous. I am currently pursuing my Undergrad from BITS Pilani (Pilani Campus). Pilani is a small town in Rajasthan. It is the birthplace of Shri GD Birla. I am enrolled as a dual degree first year student. I am doing MSc(hon) Maths. My BE degree will be decided after 1st year. It will be decided on the basis of my CGPA and branch preference. 
 The campus is huge. There is a lot of greenery. The view of clock tower from the NAB slope is just amazing. The cricket grounds are a bit small but they are good. Overall BITS Pilani is a great place to be. BITS Pilani is truly magic!
