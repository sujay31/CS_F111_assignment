A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks. A "complete" computer including the hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment required and used for "full" operation can be referred to as a computer system. This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a computer network or computer cluster.

Without computers we would still be in the dark ages of business where people had to close up shop twice a year to do “inventory”. People would actually have to visit stores, pick up what they wanted and lug it home. Computers have totally changed the world in ways we didn’t dream about even ten years ago. Imagine trying to work without computers now. With the large changes in population it would be almost impossible to have a world economy.

The development of modern day computers is the result of advancement in the field of technology.Computer Systems are shrinking from desktops to palmtops. The rapid growth of technology has always provided a new challenge which simulates a new idea to make smaller and faster computers. I think that the most mind-blowing thing is how computers emerge from very simple operations and basic concepts to something of nearly limitless potential and power. And even more importantly, how that property of emergence is related to life for example and the universe in general. From Engineers to Doctors, Students, Teachers, Government Organization they all use computers to perform specific tasks, for entertainment or just to finish office work. Computers have made our life easier. With greater precision and accuracy and less time taking computers can do alot in short time while that task can take a lot of time while doing manually. Computers have taken industries and businesses to a whole new level. 

The computer is an evidence for evolution. No person in today's world can imagine a life without computers. Thats how important they have become for the humans. Computers have great advanntages only if used ethically. I hope everyone uses them for good purposes and witness the world grow.
